        We all knew this day was coming, but I’m still not sure anyone was quite
        willing to accept it.

      <p class="text">
        Some might think you had to field questions about your retirement for a
        while because of your age. It’s not that Ross. It’s because your shoes
        will be so hard to fill. They might be impossible to fill. They don’t
        ask those questions because they’re waiting for you to move on, they ask
        them because they know that today is the end of an era. The end of our
        time with an absolute legend of New Zealand cricket, and I just want to
        say thank you.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I am 32 now, and I have been watching cricket my whole life. I have seen
        your entire career from start to finish, and it truly has been a
        privilege. I don’t think I was quite old enough to fully appreciate what
        a world class player looked like for a long time. New Zealand has always
        been, and probably will always be, a team of cricketing underdogs,
        competing in a sport against countries that are orders of magnitudes
        larger than us - by population and often by budget. We struggle to
        produce truly world class players because of it, and although I saw a
        lot of McCullum and Vettori and Fleming, I never got to fully appreciate
        their entire careers.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        But I did with you Ross. All the way from when I heard about someone
        coming through the ranks for Central Districts smacking it to all parts,
        through to the incredible record you have fashioned for yourself in all
        formats now. Someone who was a bit raw, but was powerful and aggressive.
        Someone who had the potential to take the next step. Not just to
        national honours, but someone who could be something special. Someone
        genuinely world class.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        At that time, New Zealand just didn’t have anyone who had truly taken
        that next step. We had good players, we even had players who would go on
        to be great, but no one was truly world class in all conditions - or,
        unfortunately, no one that could stay healthy long enough to really
        prove it. Although we had some great successes, our 6th and 5th place
        rankings for Tests and ODI’s respectively when you began playing for the
        Black Caps felt pretty accurate. Today, you are bowing out with the
        Black Caps as tournament finalists in all three formats, currently
        ranked 1, 3, and 4, with silverware in the cabinet.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        What has happened in your career, Ross, is that you have brought about a
        true golden age of New Zealand cricket. We have world class players in
        all of our sides, including some of our best ever, and a team that has
        dominated some of the best in the business consistently, inside and
        outside New Zealand conditions. The true gift of watching top level
        sport is watching someone strive for greatness, working hard to be the
        best they can be. As you have been with New Zealand, you have strived
        for greatness, and New Zealand has come with you. We are the best we can
        be, and the best we have ever been, and it has been thanks to you, Ross.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In that time, the Black Caps have given us some unbelievable memories.
        Memories that wouldn;t have happened without you. The team that you have
        fought for and helped to forge and create, has done things that I wasn’t
        sure we could ever achieve.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I won’t forget watching you hit the winning runs in the World Test
        Championship final.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I won’t forget the 2019 World Cup, including your crucial innings
        against India, and that very special final.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I won’t forget the 2015 World Cup that you were such a key part of. The
        Southee show against England, the Guptill show against the West Indies,
        Kane winning one of the best ever games against Australia and looking
        positively bored while doing it, and I won’t forget Grant Elliott hit
        the most beautiful six I may ever have the privilege to see. These are
        your teams Ross, and they are some of the best we have ever had.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I certainly won’t forget you going to Australia and hitting an
        exceptional Australian team for the highest score ever by a visitor to
        Australia, or coming back to dismantle England for 181* on one leg. You
        even led the Black Caps to our first win in Australia for 26 years.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        That side that you helped forge and create even went about setting world
        records and historical performances that will sit in cricketing history
        forever. You took a catch when Ajaz Patel did the inconceivable against
        a great Indian side in their own conditions. You played in the games
        where we hit both the fastest ever test century in Christchurch, and the
        fastest ODI century at the time in Queenstown. You got the best seat in
        the house watching us bowl England out in 94 minutes with the pink ball,
        still the fastest we have ever bowled a team out. You played in an all
        time great 2007 Chappell-Hadlee series, where Australia took their only
        10 wicket loss in ODI’s to date, and helped us chase 335+ in both of the
        next two games. That team of yours even got the test triple century
        monkey off our collective backs. You may not have been playing in that
        game, but that was your team Ross.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The record books are simply laden with your influence, individually and
        as a team, and I hope in time you get to reflect on the impact you have
        had. You have been a wonderful player and role model, and watching your
        journey from young gun to New Zealand cricket legend has been fantastic.
        A true and genuine great, your career has been glorious and it has been
        inspiring to see. You have become so much, the team has become so much,
        and it wouldn’t have happened without you. In your time Ross, I have
        watched you turn the Black Caps into a champion side that has a genuine
        argument as the best team in the world in any form of cricket. It is a
        true Golden Age for New Zealand cricket.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        That will be your legacy Ross. You were instrumental in turning a team
        with unrealised potential, into the best team we have ever had and an
        international force. You have been incredible to watch, a gentleman, a
        servant to the game, a human being, and an inspiration to so many. I
        hope you enjoy your time after playing, and I sincerely wish you all the
        best.
