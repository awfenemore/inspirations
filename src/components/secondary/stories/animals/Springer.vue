          Springer, also known as A73, is a wild orca living in the North
          Pacific Ocean, who is the only orca (and one of a small number of
          animals ever) to be lost or captured, and successfully reintegrated
          back to the wild. Springer was orphaned and lost in Puget Sound in
          January 2002, and over 7 months was cared for, rehabilitated,
          transported, and successfully reintroduced to her wild family. She is
          seen by whale watchers every year and is rearing her second calf with
          the pod she joined after being re-released in July 2002.

      Springer the orca was born either late 1999 or early 2000, to one of
      several orca pods that regularly roam the waters around Vancouver Island,
      B.C., Canada. Around 500 orcas roam these waters in separate pods and can
      be identified by distinctive features and markings thanks to years of
      research on these animals. Once old enough, each is given a nickname. Her
      official name is A73, but I prefer Springer.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      The research on these pods is so good that it is even known that
      Springer’s mother was Sutlej, A45, who died some time in 2001. Springer
      came to public attention when in January 2002, at the age of 2 years, and
      at a time when she should have been by her mother’s side at all times, she
      had appeared alone in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, close to 400km
      away from her “home waters”.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      It isn’t known how long Springer had been by herself for, but with orca
      father’s not taking a role in raising their young, Springer was an orphan.
      Orca’s are exceptionally social and intelligent creatures, and Springer
      was spending her time in Puget Sound nuzzling boats and logs for
      affection. This is a dangerous pastime in one of the busier shipping lanes
      in America, and as Springer’s public status grew, she began to show
      interest in people, and the public began to interact with her. With all
      the traffic around her, coupled with people beginning to feed her and
      befriend her, her living situation in Puget Sound was quickly becoming
      untenable.

      Early on in the picture, efforts were made to identify Springer. The orcas
      frequenting the area can be identified both by their unique markings and
      distinct features, but their pods can be identified by their unique
      vocalisations. Springer had been calling to other orcas in a fashion
      consistent with the vocalisations of a pod known as the Northern Resident
      Community. This group of around 215 orcas, was rarely seen in Puget Sound,
      however it was known that Sutlej, A45, had not returned to this pod with
      her calf the previous summer, and both were feared dead. Springer was this
      calf, who through a small miracle was alive, though she was underweight,
      malnourished, suffering from a skin condition, and was lost in a dangerous
      place. Something needed to be done for Springer, but it was not clear what
      that thing should be.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      Re-integrating a wild cetacean had never truly been attempted (see Keiko,
      for example), and although most people had Springers’ best interests in
      mind, it took months to form a plan for how to move her from Puget Sound
      to somewhere safe. Some wanted to see her in an aquarium, some wanted
      nature to “take it’s course”, but enough people wanted to see her returned
      safely to the wild that the decision was made to try and safely release
      her in a region that she could succeed in. This would mean capturing
      Springer, treating her health conditions, helping her reach a healthy
      weight, transporting her to a spot where she could reach her familial pod,
      and being accepted by the pod when she found them. Any one of these tasks
      was exceptionally difficult just by itself, and Springer had to do all of
      them just to have a chance at success in the wild, all while being the
      equivalent age of a human toddler.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      After months of disagreement over how best to handle the situation (that
      you are welcome to read about here), on June 12th 2002, Springer was
      (gently) captured and moved to a seapen, where she could undergo medical
      tests and eat freely to gain weight. The capture team had a lot of spent
      time specifically getting her used to the feel of the soft ropes used, the
      sounds of boats and boat engines, and to some human touch, to keep her as
      calm as possible for the trials she was about to face. Springer was fed
      around 30kg of live salmon each day, sometimes medicated, specially
      delivered down a chute to her pen so that she never associated human
      interaction with feeding. After a nervous wait, her medical tests returned
      to show that she was healthy enough to return to the wild, and after
      gaining some weight, preparations were made for her big move.

      It was known that Springers extended pod was present in Johnstone Strait,
      400km away, between early May and late July each year, and especially in
      mid July. On July 9th, orca calls closely related to Springers’ were
      detected moving towards Johnstone Strait, and Springer’s best opportunity
      for success arose. The next day, the A11 matriline pod appeared in the
      strait, Springer’s extended family, and Springer herself was made ready to
      move on July 13th. She was lifted from the water and placed in a specially
      constructed pool on the deck of a catamaran for what would be a 13 hour
      journey north towards her family. When Springer reached her new seapen in
      Johnstone Strait, it was not known how long she may need to get used to
      the new conditions, but she immediately fed, breached, pushed at the net,
      and made calls to her relatives nearby. In fact, her calls were so
      vigorous and so clearly her interacting with the other orcas, that the
      decision was made to release Springer the next day, and at 3:30pm, July
      14th, Springer swam straight towards her relatives.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      Perhaps a little surprised to see and hear from a lost calf after 6
      months, the pod was not sure how to react. Springer trailed the pod for a
      few days, likely unable to quite keep up after not traveling long
      distances for months. Eventually, Springer began traveling closely with
      the A4 pod, her mother’s closest relatives, and formed bonds with several
      orcas in the pod. Nodales, A51, who had lost her own calf previously, was
      seen guiding Springer away from boats as a mother orca would. Springer was
      also seen often with two other older females, Nawitti, and Yakat who is
      Springer’s great aunt. It seems that all three of these orcas took on
      surrogate mother roles for Springer, and after she was seen visiting
      rubbing beaches with her pod, it was clear that the reintroduction had
      been an unparalleled success.

      Springer returns to the same waters and has been spotted with her pod
      every year since her release. In July 2013, Springer was seen with a young
      calf, A104, nicknamed Spirit, who was confirmed to be her first offspring
      shortly after. In June 2017 she was seen with another calf, A117, this one
      named Storm, who was confirmed to be her second offspring. After at least
      6 months out of her pod with no caregiver and presumed dead, overcoming
      health issues and huge social isolation, Springer had returned to the wild
      and contributed two of her own calves to her pod. She continues to be seen
      in the same waters and is recognised by locals through her dorsal fin and
      distinctive markings.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      I absolutely love Springer’s story, and it is an amazing triumph of
      nature, both human nature and the animal world. To be able to help such a
      majestic animal in such a precarious situation return to live a normal
      life is unprecedented. To think that somewhere out there right now, is a
      fantastically intelligent, social, friendly, curious, 1 ton animal with
      the story that she has to tell is just amazing. As an ocean creature, she
      rarely sees all that much of humanity, but when she needed us the most, we
      could help her, and that is incredibly rewarding.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8">
      Did you ever hear the saying “Be the person that your dog thinks you are”?
      I like to think that one day, humanity might be as good as Springer might
      just think we are.
