    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Adam, I am very passionate about improving things, learning
      stuff, and understanding why things are how they are. I am a UX designer
      and behavioural specialist by trade, with a strong background as a
      developer, and a few other career paths earlier in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consider my passions to be the things that I love for reasons that I
      can't always explain. For me, that includes but is not limited to: games,
      sport music, travel, volunteering, design of all kinds, and animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have 5 main goals in life: to learn as much as possible, to chase all my
      passions, to make the world a better place, to constantly improve, and to
      die a grumpy old man who gave out all his love for the world while he
      still could.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am almost always open to hearing from people. the best way to contact me
      is through <a href="mailto:awfenemore@gmail.com">email</a>, but if you
      prefer to use
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awfenemore/" target="_blank"
        >Linkedin</a
      >
      that is fine too :)
