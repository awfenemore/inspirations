    whyILike:
      "I have loved Tame Impala since first hearing them in 2009, and although this isn't my favourite Tame album, I still enjoy it a lot. To me, Kevin Parker is just an interesting person who sees the world in an interesting way, and I am glad to get a glimpse of how he sees the world through his music."
